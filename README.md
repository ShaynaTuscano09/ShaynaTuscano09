### 🚀 Projects

- • Machine Learning Project on Stress Detection
In this project the data preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset and two classifiers namely Decision tree and Random forest are used to predict if the individual has stress or not and a detailed comparison is done to find the best model to solve this problem.

-• Movie Recommendation System
In this project we used content based recommendation system to recommend similar movie to the user. The data was preprocessed and the key features were extracted and text-based features were transformed into numerical representation using TFIDF and cosine similarity was used to calculate the similarity between movies.
